1. useState Hook

ans:useState to Create State Variables
The useState hook allows us to create state variables in a React function component.
We get that state variable as the first value in an array, which we can destructure and declare with const.Can Be Used Once Or Many Times
Update State Variables
useState also gives us a setter function to update the state after it is created.

To update our state variable, we pass the setter function the new value we want our state to be.

When you declare your setter function, in most cases you will prefix it with the word "set"Can Be Used Once Or Many Times
useState can be used once or multiple times within a single component.

Sometimes you will want to create multiple state variables and other times you may want to use a single variable with an object 

2. useEffect Hook
useEffect to Perform Side Effects
useEffect lets us perform side effects in function components.

Side effects are when we need to reach into the outside world. Such as fetching data from an API or working with the DOM.
Side effects are actions that can change our component state in an unpredictable fashion (that have caused 'side effects').

useEffect accepts a callback function (called the 'effect' function), which will by default run every time the component re-renders.

In the example below, we are interacting with the DOM to change style properties of the document body:

Run Again when a Value Changes
useEffect lets us conditionally perform effects with the dependencies array.

The dependencies array is the second argument passed to useEffect.

If any one of the values in the array changes, the effect function runs again.

If no values are included in the dependencies array, useEffect will only run on component mount and unmount.
